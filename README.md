## folketelling-1835.csv

Agricultural figures from
[Folketellingen 1835](https://www.ssb.no/a/folketellinger/fob1835.html)
per [prestegjeld](https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/Prestegjeld)
in machine-readable form.

Names of prestegjeld and all the headings are exactly as given in the
original, but the column `Nr` has been added to make names unique.
The numbers in the table produce the same sums as in the original, so
all figures should be correct.

Only the figures for "Avl efter Fradrag av Uds√¶den" (harvest after
deducting seed for next harvest) have been included. If anyone wants
to add the remaining that would be very welcome.
